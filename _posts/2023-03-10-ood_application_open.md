# Seeking OODs!

Do you enjoy being a responsible adult?

If you have professional or volunteer experience as an emergency responder and want to know everything wacky that goes on behind the scenes for one full day of Firefly, OOD is the volunteer role for you!


As OOD, you will be tasked with working with the Board Member On Call to solve any problems that happen on your shift. You will be asked to use your professional judgment to develop and execute solutions to many different problems, including the occasional emergency.


**To be considered as an OOD for Firefly 2023, please fill out the [OOD volunteer application]({{ site.baseurl }}/ood_application.html) before March 17.**

All applications received before 23:59 on March 17 will receive equal consideration!


All OODs should be available to attend a full day training in Bethel, VT on 4/29. The training is designed to be highly practical and to prepare OOD and Board on Call volunteers to work together on shift at Firefly!


I will follow up with applicants via email over the week following March 17 to arrange a short phone interview. This phone call is the final step in the OOD application process.


Everyone who applies by March 20 will be notified about whether they have been selected for a shift before March 31. Candidates are still encouraged to apply after March 20 and will be considered on a rolling basis until all shifts are filled.

Thanks, and see you in the woods!!

Best,
